## Island of Truthtellers and Liars

### Question 1

Ellen comes across three strangers, **A**, **B**, & **C**.

* **A** remains silent.

* **B** says: All of us belong to the Liar 😈 tribe.

* **C** says: Exactly one of us is from the Truthteller 😇 tribe.

What tribe does each of the three belong to?

### Solution

A -> Liar 😈
B -> Liar 😈
C -> Truthteller 😇

Explanation: **B** says “All of us are knaves.” This statement (“All of us are Liars) is either true or it is false. It cannot possibly be true, for if it were true, then they would all be Liars, but then **B** would be a Liar saying a true statement! So, **B**'s statement cannot be true, which means two things:
1. Black is a Liar.
2. It is not true that they are ALL Liars. At least one must be a Truthteller. Either **A**, **C**, or both **A** and **C**.

**C** says: “Exactly one of us is a Truthteller.” Suppose **C** is a Liar. This means **A** is the only Truthteller (remember: we know there is at least one Truthteller). But this would mean that **C**, a Liar, is telling the truth when he says there is exactly one Truthteller. Therefore, **C** must be the Truthteller. So **C** is saying the truth when she says that there is only one Truthteller. Therefore, **A** must be a Liar.
