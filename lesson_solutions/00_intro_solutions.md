## Solutions

### Hats

The person in front knew he was wearing a black hat because:
1. he knew that the first person did not see two white hats.
2. knew that the second man did not see one white hat - if he saw a white hat, the second man would have known that his hat was black after hearing the first man's statement.

### Lies or Truth

Helen asked one of them: 'If I were to ask the other person - which way should I go to reach the capital - what would the answer be?'

If the person is from the Truthtellers tribe, they would (truthfully) say the lie that the other person would tell her. So Helen would need to go in the opposite direction from the one that's being pointed.

If the person is from the Liars tribe. They would know that the other person would give the true direction. So they would lie and give the false one. So Hellen would need to go in the opposite direction from the one that's being pointed.

### Deadly Choice

"I will be killed by trampling of wild buffalo."

The King can't say it is true, because if so the man should be killed by the lions. But if he is killed by the lions, then his statement is false after all, and so should have been trampled by buffalo.

So the King can't tell if it is a lie or the truth, and decides to let him go.

(An alternative is "I will NOT be killed by lions.")
